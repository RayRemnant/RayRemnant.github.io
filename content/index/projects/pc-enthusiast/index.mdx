I'm a tech enthusiast with deep knowledge about the PC industry. I've made PC builds of all kinds, dealt with software issues on Windows and helped various small business owners choose and fix their tech.<br/>
I would describe myself as practical, looking for appropriate solutions that make sense economically.
