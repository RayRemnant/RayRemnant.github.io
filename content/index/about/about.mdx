<q>A grain of sand in the universe, a living being made up of purpose.</q>

I've been inspired by <a href="https://www.internethalloffame.org/inductees/aaron-swartz" target="_blank">Aaron Swartz's story</a>, by the ideas of people like <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hamdi_ulukaya_the_anti_ceo_playbook" target="_blank">Hamdi Ulukaya</a> and <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_hanauer_the_dirty_secret_of_capitalism_and_a_new_way_forward" target="_blank">Nick Hanauer</a>.

Society is defined by self-interest, an overwhelming amount of individualism eclipsing our collective efforts.

<p>
  Inequality, climate change, corruption are all part of the machiavellian
  vision that one's interest is valued above everyone else's. <br />
  <q>The end justifies the means</q>
</p>

    But why would you write this in an about me section?
    <br />
    Is that really relevant?

I feel like work is a representation of what we care about, of what is really worth spending your time on.

I want to contribute to a better future on a fundamental level, something that empowers and embraces every human being.
